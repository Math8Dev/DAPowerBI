# The Project

This was developed to show my knowledge in PowerBI.

It's a simple project to analyse the DOLAR-REAL currency over some period:
- It accesses a web database by URL
- It displays a time-based graph with a tool to filter the period
- It also shows some cards with information about the maximum, the minimum and the last value on the graph
- It also contians a graph to exibit the difference between the value for buying and for selling Dolars
